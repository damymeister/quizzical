## Quizzical
Quizzical allows you to participate in multiple-choice quizzes covering various topics. You can select a quiz category, provide answers to the questions, and receive feedback on your performance. Quizzical also keeps track of your score and presents it at the end of the quiz. Quizzical now features a light and dark mode, with the component state being globally managed by React Redux. Additionally, styled components have been implemented to enhance the visual styling. These updates provide users with the option to choose between different visual themes.c
